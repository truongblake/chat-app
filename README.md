# Chat-app

A simple chat application built using the MERN stack, utilizing **Socket.io** to enable real-time messaging. This project serves as a learning exercise in WebSockets and backend integration with MongoDB to enable chat rooms with persistent chat history. Developed using **Vite** and **React**, this proof-of-concept project demonstrates real-time chat functionalities with user-defined names managed via cookies.

## Features
- **Real-time Messaging**: Powered by Socket.io for instant chat updates.
- **Persistent Chat History**: Chat rooms and their histories are saved in a MongoDB database.
- **User Identity**: Users can set a name, saved via cookies for a consistent identity in the chat.

## Purpose
This project was created to explore:
- Real-time communication using WebSockets with Socket.io
- Backend development with MongoDB in a MERN stack environment
- Frontend development using Vite and React for responsive user interfaces
